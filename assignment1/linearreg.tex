\section*{Linear programming}
A dealer wishes to purchase a number of fans and sewing machines. He has only \rupee~5,760 to invest and has a space for at most 20 items.A fan costs him \rupee~360 and a sewing machine \rupee~240. His expectation is that he can sell a fan at a profit of \rupee~22 and a sewing machine at a profit of \rupee~18. Assuming that he can sell all the items that he can buy, how should he invest his money in order to maximise the profit ? Formulate this as a linear programming problem and solve it graphically.
