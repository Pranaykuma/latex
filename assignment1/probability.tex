\item On a multiple choice examination with three possible answers (out of which only one is correct) for each of the five questions, what is the probability that a candidate would get four or more correct answers just by guessing?  

\item Colored balls are distributed in three bags as shown in the following table:

A bag is selected at random, and then two balls are randomly drawn from the selected bag. They happen to be black and red. What is the probability that they came from Bag I?
